# AI-Powered Real-Time Call Intelligence & CRM Insights System

### Background

Modern organizations rely on CRM systems and cloud telephony platforms to manage customer interactions. However, most systems lack real-time transcription, live sentiment monitoring, and automated AI-generated summaries.

Using large AI models for summarization requires high infrastructure, while external AI APIs increase cost and latency.

There is a need to build a **scalable, cost-effective, low-latency AI solution** that integrates real-time speech-to-text with CRM-based summary generation and performance insights.

### Problem Description

Organizations currently do not have:

* Live transcription during active calls
* Real-time sentiment tracking and escalation alerts
* Automated CRM call summaries
* Cost-efficient and scalable AI architecture

Supervisors cannot monitor calls instantly, and CRM updates are often manual and delayed.

The objective is to build a unified AI-powered system that enables live transcription, sentiment detection, automated summaries, and actionable CRM insights with high reliability and low operational cost.

### Key Features

* Real-Time Transcription with multi-language support
* Live Sentiment Detection & Escalation Alerts
* AI-Based Call Summary Generation
* CRM Performance Insights Dashboard
* Scalable & Cost-Optimized Architecture

### Expected Solution

The solution should deliver:

* Real-time speech-to-text integrated with telephony
* AI-based summarization and CRM insights module
* Sentiment detection with alert mechanism
* Scalable architecture design
* Cost and performance comparison
* Production-ready deployment
